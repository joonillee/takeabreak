# takeabreak

for someone who sits in front of computer 25 hours? a day :)

Do you know anyone like this? Maybe It's you that would need this code :)

very simple python code to pop a window with refreshing music in every 2 hours 
to encourage you to take a break

you can adjust time to inside time.sleep() to any interval you like

for testing purpose, I used 10 seconds
